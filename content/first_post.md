Summary: This is a summary of the first post written for our Pelican blog. We're using this for the 100daysofweb course.

##Big heading for a big day!

This is the first paragraph of our article.

We're writing this in Markdown format so we can use two * symbols to indicate a **bold** formatted block of text. 

### A slightly smaller header..

We can also use a single star around a block of text to indicate an *italicised* word.

THE END!
